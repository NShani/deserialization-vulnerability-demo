# deserialization-vulnerability-demo

In this project we do a demo of the deserialization vulnerability. The demo is based on 3 main libraries/frameworks which are vulnerable to this deserialization vulnerability according to their implementation.
 

## TODO 
1. Adding user guide
2. Make scalable
3. Point to white paper
